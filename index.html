    <p><b>- - Lyrics - -</b><br>
        <br>
        I got a haircut in Norway<br>
    When all the weight started pulling me down<br>
    Smelling like a waterlogged, wet dog<br>
    Ain't no way to travel<br>
    But as soon as I chopped it all off<br>
    It just grew back, thick and brown<br>
    I keep tugging on the thread<br>
    Hoping it all might come unraveled<br>
    I keep trying to throw it all away<br>
    But it comes right back around<br>
    <br>
    They come backstage and on my bus<br>
    Pretending to be my friend<br>
    Shaking hands behind grandstands<br>
    All wearing the same old grin<br>
    Oh, but none of them bother knocking<br>
    Oh, they all just come on in<br>
    Asking me what all my songs mean<br>
    Wonderin' if they're all about them<br>
    <br>
    Mercury must be in retrograde again<br>
    But at least it's not just hangin' around, pretendin' to be my friend<br>
    Oh, the road to Hell is paved with cruel intention<br>
    If it's not nuclear war, it's gonna be a divine intervention<br>
    <br>
    Living the dream makes a man wanna scream<br>
    Light a match and burn it all down<br>
    Head back home to the mountain<br>
    Far away from all of the pull<br>
    Oh, all the journalists and sycophants wielding their brands<br>
    And all the traveling trophies and award show stands<br>
    And all the haters wishing they was in my band<br>
    Sorry, boys, the bus is plumb full<br>
    <br>
    Mercury must be in retrograde again<br>
    But at least it's not just hangin' around, pretendin' to be my friend<br>
    Oh, the road to Hell is paved with cruel intention<br>
    If it's not nuclear war, it's gonna be a divine intervention<br>
    <br>
    And there's nothing for me outside this hotel room<br>
    But another letdown, lonely day<br>
    Tour is almost over, and I'll be home soon<br>
    And it's all been done two or three times anyway<br>
    <br>
    Mercury must be in retrograde again<br>
    But at least it's not just hangin' around, pretendin' to be my friend<br>
    Oh, the road to Hell is paved with cruel intention<br>
    If it's not nuclear war, it's gonna be a divine intervention</p>

    <p><b>- - Lyrics - -</b><br>
        <br>
        Yeah, I'm a turner<br>
    I turn pages all the time<br>
    Don't like where I'm at, 34 was bad<br>
    So I just turn to 35<br>
    <br>
    Yeah, I'm a keeper<br>
    I keep digging down for the deep<br>
    Like the records I'm playing<br>
    They might keep you waiting<br>
    But you know I'm gonna play 'em for keeps<br>
    <br>
    And if the house just keeps on winning<br>
    I got a wildcard up my sleeve<br>
    And if love keeps giving me lemons<br>
    I'll just mix 'em in my drink<br>
    And if the whole wide world stops singing<br>
    And all the stars go dark<br>
    I'll keep a light on in my soul<br>
    Keep a bluebird in my heart<br>
    <br>
    Well, I'm a giver<br>
    Yeah, and I'm still giving 'em hell<br>
    Forgiving's pretty hard<br>
    So I made an art out of forgettin' 'em well<br>
    <br>
    Yeah, I'm a rhymer<br>
    I can turn twenty cents into a ten<br>
    And if I get confused, and I start to lose<br>
    I rhyme a dime 'til it all makes sense<br>
    <br>
    And if the house just keeps on winning<br>
    I got a wildcard up my sleeve<br>
    And if love keeps giving me lemons<br>
    I'll just mix 'em in my drink<br>
    And if the whole wide world stops singing<br>
    And all the stars go dark<br>
    I turn the light on in my soul<br>
    And keep a bluebird in my heart<br>
    <br>
    Ooh, ooh<br>
    <br>
    And if the house just keeps on winning<br>
    I got a wildcard up my sleeve<br>
    And if love starts giving me lemons<br>
    Just mix 'em in my drink<br>
    And if the whole wide world stops singing<br>
    And all the stars go dark<br>
    I'll keep the light on in my soul<br>
    Keep a bluebird in my heart<br>
    <br>
    I'll keep a light on in my soul<br>
    Keep a bluebird in my heart<br>
    Keep a bluebird in my heart<br>
    <br>
    Ooh<br>
    <br>
    And the bluebird sings<br>
    <br>
    Ooh</p>

        She said, "We're only young once"<br>
    The back of a Chevrolet<br>
    "Hey Now", on the radio<br>
    Ashes in the tray<br>
    You can only get drunk once<br>
    On this kind of naivety<br>
    Who knows how long we're always gonna feel this way?<br>
    <br>
    Time goes by<br>
    And it'll dull the razor<br>
    And we don't know why<br>
    Let's worry 'bout that later<br>
    'Cause if we never do nothin' else stupid<br>
    If we never do nothin' else stupid<br>
    At least we know someday<br>
    That we can look back and say<br>
    We were young once<br>
    <br>
    We were young once<br>
    We were gung-ho, singing in the sun once<br>
    Backroads in the wild, on the run once<br>
    Cheap thrills, doing things in the wheat fields<br>
    We were young, we were young, we were young once<br>
    We were young once<br>
    <br>
    She said, "Let's get a cheap hotel<br>
    And make out in the hall<br>
    I'll cover up your mouth<br>
    And play it cool if my parents call"<br>
    Let's get lost tonight<br>
    Before the world's too small<br>
    Someday we're gonna know too much to know it all<br>
    <br>
    Time goes by<br>
    And it'll dull the razor<br>
    And we don't know why<br>
    Let's worry 'bout that later<br>
    'Cause if we never do nothin' else stupid<br>
    If we never do nothin' else stupid<br>
    At least we know someday<br>
    We can look back and say<br>
    We were young once<br>

    Cheap thrills, doing things in the wheat fields<br>
    We were young, we were young, we were young once<br>
    We were young, we were young, we were young once<br>
    We were young, we were young, we were young once<br>
    We were young once<br>
